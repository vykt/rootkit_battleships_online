See the block comment on top of each file for overview. Briefly:

1) Battleships_Online.sh runs menu.py

2) menu.py progresses the user through around 4 main menues, first
   setting up a connection and then building the game.

3) The menues call upon draw.py for major print statements and drawing
   maps.

4) map.py handles all map operations, as well as high level communication
   between the two players' maps.

5) game.py handles low level sockets and catches their exceptions, as well
   as storing exit functions for the program in case of connection break.
